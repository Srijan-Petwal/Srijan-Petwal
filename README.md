## 🧠 About Me

> 🔍 **Curious by nature. Coder by choice. Creative by accident.**  
> 🎯 I build things that *immerse*, *move*, *talk*, and *sometimes think*(what is thinking actually?).  

---

🧩 **What I Do:**

- 🌐 Craft powerful **Web Apps** that feel light and move fast  
- 🎮 Build immersive **3D Games & Experiences** (yes, playable in your browser!)  
- 🤖 Explore the world of **AI/ML**, where machines try to outsmart me (not yet though 😉)  
- 🕊️ Believe that **freedom and liberty** — in software, speech, and life — are not optional, they’re *essential*
